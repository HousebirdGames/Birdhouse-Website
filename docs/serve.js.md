Please use with caution and report any issues you encounter. <br><br>This Node.js script automates the local development process by watching for file changes, running the build pipeline, and restarting a local server. It is designed solely for local development, not for production use, and simulates an Apache server environment to maintain consistency between development and production setups. <br><br>The script uses Chokidar to monitor changes in the project root, excluding its own directory, and manages a local server process that is restarted whenever the build completes successfully. <br><br>Please note that you will still need to manually reload your browser to see the changes. To use the script, cd into the 'Birdhouse' directory and then use `node server` or `npm run serve`. <br><br>To specify the port the server should run on, you can pass it as an argument, e.g., `node serve 3000` or `npm run serve 3000`. <br><br>You can utilize all standard pipeline flags such as -c, -v, -m, -forced, -silent, and -nl to customize the automatic build process. By default, the build is configured with -c -v -m -l -forced -nl. The -l flag is always included to ensure the build is local, overriding any -production (-p) or -staging (-s) flags.[/p]
