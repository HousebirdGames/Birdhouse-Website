By caching essential files listed in the filesToCache.js script — automatically generated during the project's build process — it ensures that these files are available from the cache when no network connection is available. <br><br>During deployment, the build pipeline automatically relocates the service worker to the root directory of the project. It also generates a config-sw.js file based on your project's config.js file. This configuration specifies the cache version and outlines which paths should be excluded from caching. The cache version, dictated by config.js, is pivotal for cache management and is refreshed anytime there's a version update via the pipeline. <br><br>When handling requests to the database (indicated by URLs starting with "database/..."), the service worker attempts to fetch the data from the network first. If the network request fails, it looks for the data in the cache. Failing to find the data in the cache too, it returns a status code of 503, signaling service unavailability. This approach ensures data availability, even in offline scenarios, enhancing the user experience by leveraging modern web capabilities.[/p]
