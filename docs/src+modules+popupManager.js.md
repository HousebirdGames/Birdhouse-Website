[p]You can [a href=^https://github.com/HousebirdGames/Birdhouse/blob/main/src\modules\popupManager.js^]view this file on GitHub[/a].[/p][p class=^topComment justify^]This file defines the PopupManager class responsible for managing popups throughout the application. It handles the opening and closing of popups, ensuring that focus management and accessibility are taken into account. <br><br>The PopupManager is automatically instantiated in `main.js`, where a global reference is maintained for easy access across the application. Use this class to programmatically control popups, such as opening a popup when a button is clicked or closing it when the user interacts with a close button. <br><br>You can import the `popupManager` instance from `main.js` to access the PopupManager class and its methods: `openPopup` and `closePopup`. Use popupManager.openPopup(popupID) to open a popup by its ID and popupManager.closePopup(popupID) to close a popup by its ID.[/p]
