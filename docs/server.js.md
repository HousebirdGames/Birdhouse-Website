It is currently in an experimental state and may not be suitable for all use cases. Please use with caution and report any issues you encounter. <br><br>This Node.js script, serve.js, serves as a local development server by hosting static files and dynamically applying HTTP headers based on a .htaccess-like configuration. It is designed to simulate an Apache server environment, ensuring consistency between development and production setups. <br><br>The script uses the Express framework to serve content from the 'dist' directory and handle fallbacks to 'index.html' for SPA (Single Page Application) routing. It dynamically loads and applies HTTP headers from an .htaccess file located in the 'dist' directory to mirror Apache's .htaccess behavior. <br><br>While it can operate independently for basic serving needs, it is intended to be used in conjunction with a watcher script, such as serve.js, which handles file watching, build pipeline execution, and server restarts. <br><br>Please note, this script does not replace a full Apache server and is intended for local development use only.[/p]
